# SQL-Churn-Rate

This is an advanced SQL project involving using python on a jupyter notebook to create and connect to local database using PostgresSQL as the Database Engine, import csv file into the database as a table, and make analysis on user churn rates in 3 months on 2 types of products.

Instruction for code reuse is put as headings and comments in the notebook, please feel free to play with it!

To reuse the code, the following packages need to be pre-installed into your environment:

- to connect to Postgres: sqlalchemy, psycopg2
- for data manipulation: pandas, datetime

Happy data sciencing!
